;; kage-mode is simply derived from go-mode
(define-derived-mode kage-mode go-mode "Kage shader script"
  "Major mode for editing Ebitengine Kage shader files.

This mode provides all the features go-mode provides, since kage files
are go compatible.

It also supports the use of gofmt -s. If you want to use it, add this
to your config:

\(add-hook 'before-save-hook #'kage-gofmt-before-save)"
  (run-hooks 'kage-mode-hook))

;; we need to have  our own call to gofmt, because  the one in go-mode
;; only works with *.go files, but we use the original call to it anyway
(defun kage-gofmt-before-save ()
  "Execute gofmt, intended to be put into before-safe-hook"
  (interactive)
  (when (eq major-mode 'kage-mode) (gofmt)))

;; autoloaders
(autoload 'kage-mode "kage-mode")
(autoload 'kage-gofmt-before-save "execute gofmt on write")
